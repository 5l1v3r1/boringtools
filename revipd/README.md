<h3><em>Reverse IP Domain<em></h3>

<h3>This script has made with help of search-engine of yougetsignal website</h3>

<h4>Made only for study, this script can search all websites in a determined host/domain,
when he end to search ,he save in a file with all the search.
</h4>

If do you want create your "signal pirate"  for yougetsignal server you need know this:<br>
Between the "requests"  that the  server does ,we can extract this payload:

remoteAddress:<strong>TARGET</strong>&key:<strong><empty></strong>

So just create in python a payload(library - ' <strong>requests</strong>' ) :

Like This - > <em>payload = {"remoteAddress":host,"key":""}</em>>
Where 'host'  is a variable.
